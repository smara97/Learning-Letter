# Learning-Letter
Learning letter learn children the alphabet of English language :
In this project, you are required to implement a simple web application that allows kids in
schools to learn the basic English Alphabet. The basic idea is that, the user will choose
the number of letters he wants to learn, and when clicking on each letter, another page is
opened showing an image of something that begins with that letter. In addition, some user
interaction events are collected and stored in the localStorage object of the browser to be
used in subsequent versions of the project.
The application should look something like the following:
ï‚· It has an index.html page contains a number input and a button. The user chose
how many letters [1,26] he wants to learn, then he presses Generate. A randomly
chosen letters should be selected. For example, if the user wants to learn 3 letters,
he uses the number input field and chose 3, then presses Generate and after that he will
get 3 randomly chosen letters from the English alphabet.
